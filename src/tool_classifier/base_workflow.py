class BaseWorkflow(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for all workflow executors.

    This class defines the contract that all workflow implementations must follow.
    Each workflow must implement both streaming and non-streaming execution methods.

    Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern
    - Each workflow is a concrete strategy for handling queries
    - ToolClassifier acts as the context that selects the appropriate strategy

    Workflows:
    - ServiceWorkflowExecutor: Handles external service/API calls
    - ContextWorkflowExecutor: Handles conversation history and greetings
    - RAGWorkflowExecutor: Handles knowledge base retrieval (existing)
    - OODWorkflowExecutor: Handles out-of-domain queries

    Return None Pattern:
    Workflows return None when they cannot handle a query, triggering
    fallback to the next layer in the classification chain.
