Here is the API endpoint we want to enrich for better semantic search retrieval:
<endpoint>
Name: {name}
Description: {description}
Parameters: {params_summary}
</endpoint>

Please generate a rich, detailed context that describes this API endpoint comprehensively for semantic search.
Keep the prose context general and country-agnostic. Include information about:
- What the user wants to accomplish by calling this endpoint
- Key terms and synonyms for this action
- Related concepts and use cases
- Common ways users might ask for this functionality in natural language

IMPORTANT: Generate the prose context and the example questions in the SAME LANGUAGE as the endpoint description above. However, always use the exact section header "Example queries:" in English regardless of language — this is a required machine-readable marker.

IMPORTANT for example queries: This is a system built for Estonian government digital services (Bürokratt). Ground the examples in an Estonian context — use Estonian cities (Tallinn, Tartu, Pärnu, Narva), Estonian institutions, and Estonia-relevant scenarios. Only use non-Estonian locations if the endpoint is explicitly about comparing or fetching data for multiple countries.

Then add a section with exactly {example_count} realistic and diverse example questions a real user might ask when they need this endpoint. Cover different phrasings, synonyms, and indirect ways of asking — do not just repeat the description verbatim.

Example queries:
- <example question 1>
- <example question 2>
- <example question 3>
- <example question 4>
- <example question 5>

Answer only with the enriched context and example queries — nothing else."""
